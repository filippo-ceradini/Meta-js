            But don't worry, after this is all building!

        <p>JavaScript is a loosely typed language, which means that variables can change their data type during runtime.
            Type coercion is the process of converting one data type to another implicitly or explicitly.</p>
        <h2>Implicit Type Coercion</h2>
        <p>Implicit type coercion is the automatic conversion of one data type to another data type, which is performed
            by JavaScript behind the scenes. It can occur in different situations, such as when using operators,
            comparing values, or passing arguments to functions.</p>
        <p>Here are some examples of implicit type coercion:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><code>1 + '2' // '12'</code> - In this example, the number 1 is implicitly converted to a string, and
                then concatenated with the string '2'.
            </li>
            <li><code>'3' == 3 // true</code> - In this example, the string '3' is implicitly converted to the number 3,
                and then compared with the number 3.
            </li>
            <li><code>true == 1 // true</code> - In this example, the boolean value true is implicitly converted to the
                number 1, and then compared with the number 1.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Explicit Type Coercion</h2>
        <p>Explicit type coercion is the manual conversion of one data type to another data type, which is performed
            using JavaScript functions or operators. It is also known as type casting.</p>
        <p>Here are some examples of explicit type coercion:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><code>Number('5') // 5</code> - In this example, the string '5' is explicitly converted to a number
                using the Number() function.
            </li>
            <li><code>String(123) // '123'</code> - In this example, the number 123 is explicitly converted to a string
                using the String() function.
            </li>
            <li><code>Boolean(0) // false</code> - In this example, the number 0 is explicitly converted to a boolean
                value using the Boolean() function.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Preventing Type Coercion Issues</h2>
        <p>Type coercion can cause issues in JavaScript programs, especially when comparing values or using conditional
            statements. To prevent type coercion issues, it's recommended to use strict equality (===) instead of loose
            equality (==), and to explicitly convert values to the expected data type using the appropriate functions or
            operators.</p>
        <p>For example:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><code>'3' === 3 // false</code> - Using strict equality, the string '3' is not equal to the number 3, so
                the comparison returns false.
            </li>
            <li><code>Number('3') === 3 // true</code> - Explicitly converting the string '3' to a number using the
                Number() function, the comparison returns true.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h1>Fetch() in JavaScript</h1>

        The <code>fetch()</code> function is a built-in function in JavaScript used to make asynchronous HTTP
        requests
        to servers.
        It returns a promise that resolves to the response of the request.
        The response is an object that represents the response received from the server.
    </p>
    <p>
        The <code>fetch()</code> function takes in one required parameter, the URL of the resource that is being
        requested.
        It can also take in an optional second parameter, an object that can include different configurations for
        the
        request.
        For example, headers, method, body, mode, cache, credentials, and redirect.
    </p>
    <p>
        Here's an example of how to use <code>fetch()</code>:
    </p>
    <pre>
      <code>
        fetch('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/1')
          .then(response => response.json())
          .then(data => console.log(data))
          .catch(error => console.error(error));
      </code>
    </pre>

        <h1>Callback Functions</h1></div>

    <p>A callback function is a function that is passed as an argument to another function, with the intention that it
        will be called at a later point in time. This allows for the parent function to execute its logic while the
        callback function handles any asynchronous tasks, such as fetching data or handling events.</p>
    <p>When a function receives a callback function as an argument, it can store that function in a variable or pass it
        along to another function for later execution. When the parent function completes its execution, it can then
        call the callback function, passing along any necessary arguments.</p>
    <p>For example, let's say we have a function that fetches data from an API:</p>
    <pre>
        <code>
        function fetchData(url, callback) {
          const xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();
          xhr.onreadystatechange = function() {
            if (xhr.readyState === 4 && xhr.status === 200) {
              callback(xhr.responseText);
            }
          }
          xhr.open('GET', url);
          xhr.send();
        }
        </code>
    </pre>
    <p>To use this function, we would pass in a callback function as the second argument:</p>
    <pre>
    <code>
        fetchData('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users', function(data) {
          console.log(data);
        });
    </code>
  </pre>
    <p>Callback functions are commonly used for handling asynchronous code, such as making API requests or handling
        events. Here are a few examples:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>API Requests:</strong> As we saw in the example above, callback functions are commonly used when
            making API requests. The parent function can handle setting up the request and parsing the response, while
            the callback function handles what to do with the data.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Event Handling:</strong> When working with events in JavaScript, callback functions are often used
            to handle the event. For example, when a button is clicked, a callback function can be called to perform a
            specific action.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Asynchronous Operations:</strong> Callback functions are also useful for handling any kind of
            asynchronous operation, such as reading a file or performing a complex calculation. The callback function
            can be used to handle the result of the operation.
        </li>
    </ul>
