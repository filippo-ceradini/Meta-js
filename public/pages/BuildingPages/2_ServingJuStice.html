    <h2>Node.js installation</h2>

    <p>
        The easiest way to get Node.js running on MacOS is to use brew:
    </p>
    <pre>
        <code>
            brew install node
        </code>
    </pre>

    <h2>Node.js Structure</h2>
    <p>
        Node.js uses a very simple file structure: <b>package.json</b> and <b>app.js</b>.

    </p>
    <p>
        The <b>package.json</b> file is a JSON file that contains important information about your Node.js application,
        including its name, version, description, entry point, dependencies, and more.
        It's typically located at the root of your project directory and is automatically created when you run npm init.
        You can also manually create and edit this file.
    </p>
    <p>
        One of the key functions of the package.json file is to manage your project's dependencies.
        You can specify which dependencies your project needs by adding them to the dependencies section of the file.
        When you run <b>npm install</b> or <b>npm install &lt;package_name&gt;</b>,
        npm will automatically install the necessary dependencies and save them to the node_modules directory.
    </p>
    <pre>
        <code>
                {
                  "name": "my-website-with-node",
                  "version": "1.0.0",
                  "description": "A simple Node.js application",
                  "main": "app.js",
                  "dependencies": {
                    "express": "^4.17.1",
                  }
                }

        </code>
    </pre>
    <p>
        The <b>app.js</b> file is typically the entry point for your Node.js application.
        It contains the code that runs your application and handles incoming requests.
        This file can be named differently, but it needs to be specified in the main property of your package.json file.
    </p>
        We can so create a new project by creating an app.js file and a package.json,
    <p>

    </p>

    <h2>Packages and Dependencies</h2>

    <p>
        As introduced before Node.js has a large ecosystem of third-party modules and packages that can be installed and used in our projects
        using a package manager called npm (Node Package Manager).
        You can install a package and its dependencies by running <code>npm install &lt;package_name&gt;</code> in your
        terminal.
    </p>
    <pre>
      <code>
        // Install the is-odd package
        npm install is-odd
          // app.js
          const isOdd = require('is-odd);
          const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
          numbers.forEach(num =>{
          console.log(`is ${num} odd? `+isOdd(num))
          })

      </code>
    </pre>

    <p>
        You can also install a package and its dependencies by running <code>npm install &lt;package_name&gt;</code> in
        your terminal.
    </p>



    <h2>Express</h2>

    <p>Express is a popular, minimalist web framework for Node.js that provides a set of features for building web applications,
        APIs, and other HTTP-based services.
        Some of the key features of Express include:
    <div class="participation">
        <ul>
            <li>Routing: Express allows you to define routes for handling incoming HTTP requests based on the request method
                (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.) and the URL path.</li>
            <li>Middleware: Express uses middleware functions to handle requests and responses in a modular and reusable way.
                Middleware functions can be used to add functionality such as authentication, logging, and error handling to
                your application.</li>
            <li>Views and templates: Express supports a variety of templating engines and view libraries, allowing you to
                generate dynamic HTML, XML, and other formats.</li>
            <li>Error handling: Express provides a built-in error handling middleware function that can be used to handle errors
                and exceptions that occur during request processing.</li>
            <li>Static files: Express can serve static files such as images, CSS, and JavaScript files directly from the file
                system.</li>
        </ul>

        Let's build our website!<br>

        Create a folder, inside it a file that we're going to call package.json

        and let's structure it like this
    </p>
    <pre>
      <code>
          {
          "name": "easy-js",
          "version": "1.0.0",
          "description": "easy Js website",
          "main": "app.js",
          "license": "MIT",
          "dependencies": {
          "express": "^4.18.2"
            }
          }
      </code>
    </pre>

    <p>
        Create a file with nano and call it app.js
    </p>

    <pre>
      <code>
          nano ~/{path-to-folder}/app.js
      </code>
    </pre>

    <p>Add a nice hello world message:</p>

    <pre>
      <code>
          console.log("Hello World!")
      </code>
    </pre>

    <p>Don't forget to save! <br>
    now we can install:
    </p>

    <pre>
      <code>
          npm install
      </code>
    </pre>

    <p>And finally run:
    </p>

    <pre>
      <code>
          node app.js
      </code>
    </pre>

    <p>And that's it! Welcome to Node.Js</p>
