        Ajax, V8 and Node.Js
    </h2>
    <p>
        Ajax (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) is a technique that allows web applications to update content on a web
        page without having to refresh the entire page.
        It uses JavaScript to communicate with the server and retrieve data in the background, allowing for a more
        seamless user experience.
        Ajax was first introduced in 2005 and has become a common technique used in modern web development.

    <p>
        V8 is an open-source JavaScript engine developed by Google for use in the Google Chrome web browser.
        It compiles JavaScript code directly into machine code, making it much faster than traditional interpreted
        JavaScript engines.
        V8 is also used the Node.js server-side runtime environment.
    </p>
    <p>
        Node.js is a runtime environment that allows developers to run JavaScript code outside of a web browser .
        It provides a platform for building scalable and high-performance web
        applications.
        Node.js allows developers to use JavaScript for server-side programming, which can improve development
        efficiency and reduce the need to switch between different programming languages.

        Node.js has become increasingly popular in recent years, particularly for building real-time web applications
        such as chat applications,
        online gaming platforms, and collaborative tools. It has a large and active community of developers,
        which has created a vast ecosystem of modules and tools that can be used with Node.js to build powerful and
        scalable web applications.
