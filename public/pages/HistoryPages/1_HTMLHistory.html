    <h1>The History of HTML</h1>

    <h2>HTML 1.0</h2>
    <p>The first version of HTML, HTML 1.0, was released in 1991. It was a very basic markup language that allowed for the creation of simple text documents with headings, paragraphs, and hyperlinks. It was primarily used by researchers and academics to share documents and research findings.</p>

    <h2>HTML 2.0</h2>
    <p>HTML 2.0 was released in 1995 and included new features such as tables and image maps. Tables allowed web developers to create more complex layouts, while image maps allowed them to create clickable areas within an image.</p>

    <h2>HTML 3.2</h2>
    <p>HTML 3.2 was released in 1997 and included even more features such as frames, which allowed developers to divide a web page into multiple sections, and forms, which allowed users to input data and interact with web pages.</p>

    <h2>HTML 4.0</h2>
    <p>HTML 4.0 was released in 1997 and included improvements to existing features and new features such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and the ability to embed multimedia content such as videos and audio files.</p>

    <h2>XHTML</h2>
    <p>In 2000, the first version of XHTML (Extensible Hypertext Markup Language) was released. XHTML was essentially a stricter version of HTML that was designed to be more compatible with XML. It required that all tags be properly closed and that all attributes be quoted.</p>

    <h2>HTML5</h2>
    <p>HTML5, the current version of HTML, was first proposed in 2004 and was officially released in 2014. It introduced many new features such as new semantic elements, new form controls, and support for multimedia elements such as canvas and video. It also made it easier to create web applications by introducing new APIs for geolocation, drag and drop, and offline storage.</p>
