        Browser History
    </h2>
    <p>
        The history of web browsers can be traced back to the early days of the World Wide Web in the 1990s. The first
        web browser was created by Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web. This browser was called
        WorldWideWeb, and it was released in 1990. It was a text-based browser that allowed users to navigate the web by
        clicking on hyperlinks.</p>
    <p>
        In 1993, Marc Andreessen and Eric Bina created the Mosaic browser, which was the first graphical web browser.
        Mosaic was a huge breakthrough because it allowed users to view images and formatted text on the web. It also
        introduced the concept of inline images, which allowed images to be displayed within the text of a web page.
    </p>
        The success of Mosaic led to the creation of Netscape Navigator, which was released in 1994. Netscape Navigator
        quickly became the most popular web browser, and it played a significant role in the growth of the World Wide
        Web.
    <p>
        In 1995, Microsoft released Internet Explorer, which was included with the Windows operating system. Internet
        Explorer quickly gained popularity and became the dominant web browser in the early 2000s.</p>

        In the late 2000s, a new generation of web browsers emerged, including Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome, and Apple
        Safari. These browsers were designed to be faster and more secure than their predecessors, and they introduced
        new features such as tabbed browsing and extensions.</p>
    <p>
        Today, web browsers continue to evolve and improve, with new features such as voice recognition, artificial
        intelligence, and virtual reality being integrated into modern browsers. Web browsers are an essential part of
        our daily lives, and they have transformed the way we access and interact with information on the World Wide
        Web.
