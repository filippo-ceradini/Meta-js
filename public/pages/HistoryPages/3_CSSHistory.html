    <p> CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a language used for describing the presentation of web pages, including layout,
        colors, and fonts.
    </p>
    <p>
        The history of CSS can be traced back to the early days of the World Wide Web.<br>
        In the early 1990s, web pages were primarily created using HTML (Hypertext Markup Language). <br>
        HTML was used to
        define the structure of a web page, but it did not provide much control over the presentation of the content.

    In 1994, HÃ¥kon Wium Lie, a Norwegian web developer, proposed the idea of using style sheets to control the
    presentation of web pages. Lie worked with Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, to develop a
    prototype of a style sheet language called "Cascading HTML Style Sheets" or CHSS.
    The term "cascading" refers to the way that style rules cascade down from one style sheet to another. CSS rules
    are organized into different levels of specificity, and the most specific rules are applied to an element first.
    If two or more rules have the same level of specificity, the rule that comes later in the style sheet will
    override the previous one.

    In 1996, the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) was formed to standardize web technologies, including CSS. The first
    version of CSS, CSS1, was published in 1996, and it provided a basic set of styling capabilities, such as setting
    colors, fonts, and margins.
    <p>
        CSS2 was released in 1998 and introduced more advanced features, such as positioning, tables, and improved
        support for printing. CSS3, which was released in 1999, introduced even more features, including support for
        media queries, animations, and transformations.

        Today, CSS is an essential part of web development, and it continues to evolve with new features and
        improvements. The latest version of CSS is CSS3, which is widely supported by modern web browsers.</p>
