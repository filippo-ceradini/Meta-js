        The history of the Web is very fascinating, and an interesting starting point to understand part of the technology behind this internet marvel.
        A lot the things we take for granted today, like the ability music whenever we want, or information whenever we want to satisfy a doubt,
        could not be possible if a whole lot of people didn't collaborate to create this ginormous combinations of programs protocols and products that we refer as the internet.

        So you can browse this bit of web history as a plus in this little website, where the style grows a little bit more modern in every iteration<br>
        (mostly borrowing css from here and there because life is short and I'm not a touch typist).
        Enjoy the ride..
