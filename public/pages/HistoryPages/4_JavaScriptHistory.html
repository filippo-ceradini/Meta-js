        Javascript History
    </h2>
    <p>
        JavaScript is a programming language used primarily for creating interactive web pages and applications.
        It was created by Brendan Eich, a programmer at Netscape Communications Corporation, in just 10 days in May
        1995.
        Initially, it was called Mocha, then it was renamed to LiveScript, and finally, it was renamed to
        JavaScript.</p>

    <p>
        The primary purpose of JavaScript is to add interactivity to web pages. JavaScript allows developers to
        manipulate the content of a web page dynamically and respond to user events such as mouse clicks,
        button presses, and form submissions. This allows for a more interactive and engaging user experience.
    </p>
        In the early days of the web, JavaScript was used primarily for simple animations and form validation.
        However, as web technology has evolved, JavaScript has become more powerful and versatile.
        It is now used for a wide range of applications, including web and mobile app development, game development,
        server-side programming, and more.
    <p>
        One of the reasons for the widespread adoption of JavaScript is its compatibility with all major web browsers.
        Almost all modern web browsers support JavaScript, and many web developers consider it an essential skill.
        JavaScript frameworks and libraries such as jQuery, React, and Angular have made it easier for developers to
        build complex web applications.
    </p>
    <p>
        These tools provide pre-written code and standardized ways of working with JavaScript, making it easier for
        developers to create web applications more efficiently.
        Today, JavaScript is one of the most popular programming languages in the world, with a vibrant community of
        developers continually working to improve the language and its ecosystem.
